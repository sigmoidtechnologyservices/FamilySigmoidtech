Family Gem is a free app for Android that let you create complete genealogical trees.

With Family Gem you can:

* Create a family tree from scratch, entering names, dates, places, events, photos and sources.
* Import an existing family tree through a GEDCOM file and modify it as you like.
* Export the family tree you created (via GEDCOM again) to every other genealogy program.
* Share a tree with your relatives, letting them improve it and receiving back the updates.
