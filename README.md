# Family Gem
### _Create your own family tree_

Family Gem is an app for Android designed to manage family trees.<br>
It's completely free and open source.

## Features
With Family Gem you can:
- Create a family tree from scratch, entering names, dates, places, various events, photos and sources.
- Import an existing family tree through a GEDCOM file and modify it as you want.
- Export the family tree you created (via GEDCOM again) to import in every other genealogy program.
- Share a tree with your relatives, letting them improve it and receiving back the updates. Then you can choose whether accept them or not.

Minimum supported version is Android 4.4 KitKat (API 19), maximum is Android 11 R (API 30).<br>
The intent is that data structure respects as much as possible the latest version of GEDCOM standard: [5.5.1](https://www.familysearch.org/developers/docs/gedcom/) and possibly also [5.5.5](https://www.gedcom.org/gedcom.html).<br>
Family Gem is strongly based on the library [Gedcom 5 Java](https://github.com/FamilySearch/gedcom5-java) by FamilySearch.

There are 2 modules:
- **app** is the actual Family Gem app.
- **lab** is the Family Lab app, a playground used only to develop new features.

## Limitations
The code provided in this repository should compile and build a working version of Family Gem, but with some limitations:
|Missing|Limitation|
|-|-|
|App signature|You loose saved trees when you install over a signed version|
|Server account|You can't share trees|
|GeoNames "demo" account|Place names suggestions probably don't appear|

The code (classes, variables, comments...) is almost all written in Italian (my native language), because I started just as a personal hobby project.<br>
Obviously everyone expects an English code: it's hard to change at this point but I'm trying to translate all to English.
